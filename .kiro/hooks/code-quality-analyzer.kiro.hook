Focus on:\n\n1. **Code Smells**: Identify long methods, large classes, duplicate code, complex conditionals, and other anti-patterns\n2. **Design Patterns**: Suggest appropriate design patterns that could improve the code structure (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Builder, Observer)\n3. **Best Practices**: Check for proper exception handling, resource management, null safety, and Quarkus/Panache conventions\n4. **Readability**: Evaluate naming conventions, code organization, comments, and overall clarity\n5. **Maintainability**: Assess coupling, cohesion, single responsibility principle, and testability\n6. **Performance**: Identify potential bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, unnecessary object creation, and database query optimization opportunities\n7. **Quarkus-Specific**: Ensure proper use of CDI scopes, reactive patterns, Panache queries, and REST annotations\n\nFor each issue found:\n- Explain what the problem is and why it matters\n- Provide a specific, actionable suggestion for improvement\n- Include code examples where helpful\n- Prioritize suggestions by impact (high/medium/low)\n\nMaintain the existing functionality while suggesting improvements. Be constructive and focus on practical, implementable changes."
